* GDB (GNU Debugger):
A powerful, open-source debugger that allows you to see what is happening inside a program while it executes or when it crashes. Essential for analyzing binaries.
Add-on: GEF (GDB Enhanced Features) or Pwndbg: Extends GDB with useful features for reverse engineering and binary exploitation.
