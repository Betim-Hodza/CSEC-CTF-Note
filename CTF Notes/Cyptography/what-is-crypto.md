## What is Cryptography
Cryptography is essentially the art of **keeping information safe**. It uses a bunch of different techniques, like codes and algorithms, to scramble up data (encryption) so only authorized people can understand it. 
* It's like writing a secret message in a code book that only your friend with the key can decipher.

## Breakdown of cryptography:

* Encryption: 
  * This is the process of taking plain, readable information and turning it into an unreadable mess called ciphertext. Think of it as scrambling an egg – **you can't un-scramble it back into a perfect egg**, but you can still use it for cooking.

* Decryption: 
  * This is the flip side of encryption, where the ciphertext is turned back into readable plaintext. This is done with a special key, kind of like **needing the right key to unlock a door**.

There are different types of cryptography, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Two main ones are:

* Symmetric cryptography: 
  * Imagine two friends sharing a secret code word. **Both can encrypt messages using the code word and decrypt them using the same code word.**

* Asymmetric cryptography: T
  * his is like having two different keys – a **public key** that anyone can use to encrypt messages, and a **private key** that only the recipient has to decrypt them. It's like a public mailbox where anyone can put things in, but only the person with the key can open it and get them out.

## Where is Cryptography used?
Cryptography is all around us in the digital world, keeping our information secure. It's used for things like:

* Protecting credit card numbers and passwords when you shop online
* Securing your emails and messages
* Safeguarding online banking transactions
