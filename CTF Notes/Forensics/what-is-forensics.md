# What is Forensics?

Forensics in cybersecurity, also known as digital forensics or incident response forensics (IR forensics), is involved with investigating and responding to cyberattacks. **It's essentially the detective work done in the digital world** to **gather evidence** and **understand** how a cybercrime occurred.

## Process of Digital Forensics

Evidence Collection:

- Forensic specialists carefully collect digital evidence from devices and systems that were compromised during a cyberattack. This might involve hard drives, servers, mobile phones, or even cloud storage. The key is to preserve the evidence in a way that maintains its integrity for legal purposes.

Analysis:

- The collected evidence is **meticulously analyzed** to identify traces of the attacker's activity. This could involve looking for malware, suspicious files, network logs, or registry entries. **Forensics tools can help uncover hidden data and reconstruct timelines of events**.

Incident Response: 

- The findings from the forensic analysis are used to inform the overall incident response process. This might involve **identifying vulnerabilities** that were exploited, determining the **scope of the attack**, and taking steps to remediate the situation and prevent future attacks.

Legal Proceedings: 

- In some cases, the digital evidence collected during forensics can be used as evidence in court to prosecute cybercriminals. The forensics specialist needs to ensure the evidence is collected and documented in a way that meets legal requirements.

As far as CTFs go we are more concerned about how we use these digital forensics tools.

## Benefits of digital forensics?

Faster Recovery:

- By understanding how the attack happened, organizations can take targeted steps to **recover their systems** and **minimize downtime**.

Improved Security:

- Forensic analysis can **help identify security weaknesses** that were exploited in the attack. This allows organizations to **patch those vulnerabilities** and **improve their overall security posture**.

Deterring Criminals:

- The knowledge that a cyberattack can be forensically investigated can deter criminals, as they know they are more likely to be caught.

Legal Action: 

- **Forensic evidence can be used to hold cybercriminals accountable for their actions**.
