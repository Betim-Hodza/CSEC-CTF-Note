# What is Password Cracking
Password cracking refers to the process of trying to recover passwords from a computer system.  

## 2 common Techniques 

* Brute-force attack: 
  * This is a **trial-and-error** method where the attacker systematically **tries every possible combination** of characters until they guess the correct password. It's like trying every single key on a key ring until you find the one that unlocks the door.

* Dictionary attack: 
  * This approach uses a **list of commonly used words, phrases, and combinations** to try as passwords. Hackers might also include information specific to the victim like birthdays or names in their wordlist. It's like trying all **the most common keys** before moving on to the less common ones.

## How to prevent your password getting cracked

* Strong passwords: 
  * Use long and complex passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or pet names.
* Multi-factor authentication (MFA): 
  * MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second factor, like a code from your phone, in addition to your password to log in.
* Passkeys: 
  * Like Multifactor Authentication, passkeys are similar they add can log you into your accounts by scanning a QR code or reading a physical USB key and authenticating that it is you who is trying to access your account by reading your biometric data like your fingerprint or face.
* Password manager: 
  * using a password manager to store and generate strong passwords for all your accounts. This helps you avoid reusing passwords and makes them more difficult to crack.
